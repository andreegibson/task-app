# Task App
## A Simple Task App

### Purpose
There are probably an infinite number of these apps across the web but I am writing my own to
show my knowledge of various software engineering domains. Specifically, my aim is to
demonstrate proficiency with Java, SpringBoot, Mongo, Docker, and anything else I happen to
think of. For a front end, an area that is definitely not a strong suit for me, I plan on using React.
